    "The code cells below set up the data generators for the training and validation datasets to train the model. The settings below reproduce the original SSD training on Pascal VOC 2007 `trainval` plus 2012 `trainval` and validation on Pascal VOC 2007 `test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing you need to change here are the filepaths to the datasets on your local machine. Note that parsing the labels from the XML annotations files can take a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the generator provides two options to speed up the training. By default, it loads the individual images for a batch from disk. This has two disadvantages. First, for compressed image formats like JPG, this is a huge computational waste, because every image needs to be decompressed again and again every time it is being loaded. Second, the images on disk are likely not stored in a contiguous block of memory, which may also slow down the loading process. The first option that `DataGenerator` provides to deal with this is to load the entire dataset into memory, which reduces the access time for any image to a negligible amount, but of course this is only an option if you have enough free memory to hold the whole dataset. As a second option, `DataGenerator` provides the possibility to convert the dataset into a single HDF5 file. This HDF5 file stores the images as uncompressed arrays in a contiguous block of memory, which dramatically speeds up the loading time. It's not as good as having the images in memory, but it's a lot better than the default option of loading them from their compressed JPG state every time they are needed. Of course such an HDF5 dataset may require significantly more disk space than the compressed images (around 9 GB total for Pascal VOC 2007 `trainval` plus 2012 `trainval` and another 2.6 GB for 2007 `test`). You can later load these HDF5 datasets directly in the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original SSD implementation uses a batch size of 32 for the training. In case you run into GPU memory issues, reduce the batch size accordingly. You need at least 7 GB of free GPU memory to train an SSD300 with 20 object classes with a batch size of 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DataGenerator` itself is fairly generic. I doesn't contain any data augmentation or bounding box encoding logic. Instead, you pass a list of image transformations and an encoder for the bounding boxes in the `transformations` and `label_encoder` arguments of the data generator's `generate()` method, and the data generator will then apply those given transformations and the encoding to the data. Everything here is preset already, but if you'd like to learn more about the data generator and its data augmentation capabilities, take a look at the detailed tutorial in [this](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/data_generator_object_detection_2d) repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data augmentation settings defined further down reproduce the data augmentation pipeline of the original SSD training. The training generator receives an object `ssd_data_augmentation`, which is a transformation object that is itself composed of a whole chain of transformations that replicate the data augmentation procedure used to train the original Caffe implementation. The validation generator receives an object `resize`, which simply resizes the input images.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `SSDInputEncoder` object, `ssd_input_encoder`, is passed to both the training and validation generators. As explained above, it matches the ground truth labels to the model's anchor boxes and encodes the box coordinates into the format that the model needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to train the model on a dataset other than Pascal VOC, either choose `DataGenerator`'s appropriate parser method that corresponds to your data format, or, if `DataGenerator` does not provide a suitable parser for your data format, you can write an additional parser and add it. Out of the box, `DataGenerator` can handle datasets that use the Pascal VOC format (use `parse_xml()`), the MS COCO format (use `parse_json()`) and a wide range of CSV formats (use `parse_csv()`)."

    "We've already chosen an optimizer and set the batch size above, now let's set the remaining training parameters. I'll set one epoch to consist of 1,000 training steps. The next code cell defines a learning rate schedule that replicates the learning rate schedule of the original Caffe implementation for the training of the SSD300 Pascal VOC \"07+12\" model. That model was trained for 120,000 steps with a learning rate of 0.001 for the first 80,000 steps, 0.0001 for the next 20,000 steps, and 0.00001 for the last 20,000 steps. If you're training on a different dataset, define the learning rate schedule however you see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll set only a few essential Keras callbacks below, feel free to add more callbacks if you want TensorBoard summaries or whatever. We obviously need the learning rate scheduler and we want to save the best models during the training. It also makes sense to continuously stream our training history to a CSV log file after every epoch, because if we didn't do that, in case the training terminates with an exception at some point or if the kernel of this Jupyter notebook dies for some reason or anything like that happens, we would lose the entire history for the trained epochs. Finally, we'll also add a callback that makes sure that the training terminates if the loss becomes `NaN`. Depending on the optimizer you use, it can happen that the loss becomes `NaN` during the first iterations of the training. In later iterations it's less of a risk. For example, I've never seen a `NaN` loss when I trained SSD using an Adam optimizer, but I've seen a `NaN` loss a couple of times during the very first couple of hundred training steps of training a new model when I used an SGD optimizer."

    "In order to reproduce the training of the \"07+12\" model mentioned above, at 1,000 training steps per epoch you'd have to train for 120 epochs. That is going to take really long though, so you might not want to do all 120 epochs in one go and instead train only for a few epochs at a time. You can find a summary of a full training [here](https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras/blob/master/training_summaries/ssd300_pascal_07%2B12_training_summary.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to only run a partial training and resume smoothly later on, there are a few things you should note:\n",
    "1. Always load the full model if you can, rather than building a new model and loading previously saved weights into it. Optimizers like SGD or Adam keep running averages of past gradient moments internally. If you always save and load full models when resuming a training, then the state of the optimizer is maintained and the training picks up exactly where it left off. If you build a new model and load weights into it, the optimizer is being initialized from scratch, which, especially in the case of Adam, leads to small but unnecessary setbacks every time you resume the training with previously saved weights.\n",
    "2. In order for the learning rate scheduler callback above to work properly, `fit_generator()` needs to know which epoch we're in, otherwise it will start with epoch 0 every time you resume the training. Set `initial_epoch` to be the next epoch of your training. Note that this parameter is zero-based, i.e. the first epoch is epoch 0. If you had trained for 10 epochs previously and now you'd want to resume the training from there, you'd set `initial_epoch = 10` (since epoch 10 is the eleventh epoch). Furthermore, set `final_epoch` to the last epoch you want to run. To stick with the previous example, if you had trained for 10 epochs previously and now you'd want to train for another 10 epochs, you'd set `initial_epoch = 10` and `final_epoch = 20`.\n",
    "3. In order for the model checkpoint callback above to work correctly after a kernel restart, set `model_checkpoint.best` to the best validation loss from the previous training. If you don't do this and a new `ModelCheckpoint` object is created after a kernel restart, that object obviously won't know what the last best validation loss was, so it will always save the weights of the first epoch of your new training and record that loss as its new best loss. This isn't super-important, I just wanted to mention it."

    "`decode_detections()` with default argument values follows the procedure of the original SSD implementation: First, a very low confidence threshold of 0.01 is applied to filter out the majority of the predicted boxes, then greedy non-maximum suppression is performed per class with an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.45, and out of what is left after that, the top 200 highest confidence boxes are returned. Those settings are for precision-recall scoring purposes though. In order to get some usable final predictions, we'll set the confidence threshold much higher, e.g. to 0.5, since we're only interested in the very confident predictions."
